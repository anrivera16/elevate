  The Tailwind version of Pegasus doesn't ship with a pricing page,

  We recommend <a href="https://tailwindui.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Tailwind UI</a> for an extremely
  high-quality set of components made by the creators of Tailwind CSS,
  and <a href="https://flowbite.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Flowbite</a> as a quality free option with lots of useful components.
